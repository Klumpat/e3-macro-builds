This is my macro, e3.  It's been a work in progress for awhile now, so the more feedback I get the better.  It requires that users have 2 folders "Bot Inis" and "Macro Inis", in your Macros folder, for various inis to be written to.  Use '/e3help' while running the macro, in game, for information about functions and aspects of the macro.

Will be releasing updates periodically, check back for new versions of the macro.

**Required: Underfoot Client, MQ2EQBC, MQ2NetBots, MQ2Exchange, MQ2MoveUtils, MQ2Twist -**(optional) MQ2NetAdvPath

Hope you enjoy,

Killians
